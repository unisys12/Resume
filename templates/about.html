		<p>So, a little about myself is in order I would suspect? As you may have already noticed, my name is Phillip Jackson. I live in the small town of Corinth, Mississippi located in the northeast corner of the state, with my wife and two awesome girls. We are not form here originally, but imported from the Mississippi Delta town of Greenville. </p>
