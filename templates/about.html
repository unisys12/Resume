		<p>So, a little about myself is in order I would suspect? As you may have already noticed, my name is Phillip Jackson. I live in the small town of Corinth, Mississippi located in the northeast corner of the state, with my wife and two awesome girls. We are not from here originally, but imported from the Mississippi Delta town of Greenville. I have a very long history of being involved with technology in some way or another. I was the kid that got a new toy, play with it for 15 mins, then took it apart to find out how and why it worked. Actually, I broke the first computer I ever had because of this. It was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">TRS-80_Color_Computer</a>. My uncle, from Texas, gave it to my sister and I with a bunch of magizines that were published at the time. These hugh magizines contained programs that you would type in, save them to a cassette tape, then play back. Later in life, I became a mechanic and absolutely loved it. One problem though, your average mechanic just doesn't make a lot of money. Actually no money at all, after buying tools, covering the dealership for warrenty work, yada-yada-yada! So I left the world of grease and grim and got a good job at a factory. And it was at this factory that I was reintroduced to the world of programming. There was three lines at this factory and they all had a team of mechanics. But our line was almost totally automated and so we also had a team of computer techs. This is where I learned about sensors, actuators, solenoids and servos. And not just that, but I thought it was so cool that these guys would plug a laptop up to the line and could watch stuff as the line was running. They showed me a lot! And it was around this time that I was introduced to the internet. From the second I saw my first webpage, I was in awe. I had to know how it was done. I did not know how to write a program that installed on Windows, but I knew enough about how it worked to know that it was code that was compiled then stored locally on the PC. But this was different. This page on my monitor was not stored on my computer. I actually called my ISP and asked them how they did their web page <em>(You have to keep in mind that most websites back then was just a single page most of the time.)</em>. They pointed me to a tutorial site called <a href="htmlgoodies.com">HTML Goodies</a> and it was on! I taught myself HTML and CSS using only NOTEPAD, but never really got into JavaScript. After a year or two and a few sites, I changed jobs again. This time going to work for Xerox. I had to give up my little hobby, at this point, because the amount of training and learning I was going through was unworldly. All the while though, I still took a peek at my favorite sites to see what was new and fresh. Just never got the keyboard dirty. Not unitl about late 2009 early 2010 did I pick this passion up again. Thinking that I was going to create an Android app for the techs on my team, I began teaching myself Java. But after a few months, I basically gave up. Along the way, I was not only introduced to Java, but MySQL and had a great time with it. I was then shown the error of my ways by another tech and he introduced me to PHP. I quickly began reteaching myself HTML basics and then dove head first into the elephant. Since then, I have gained a better understanding of OOP (Biggest hurdle for me while trying to learn Java) and even picked up a greater respect and understanding of JavaScript.</p>

		<p>So what does my future hold? Well, I don't know, of course. But what I would like to see is me finally turning this passion into a career. If not a full blowen career, at least be able to make some decent side money to supplement our income. I truely believe that web development is the future, if not the basis, of almost all future advancements programming and I want to be a part of it. Not just in it, along for the ride or what have you. I want to contribute! I want to be that someone who thinks of a 'thing', make it and my 'thing' help other people. And the quickest way for me to get to reach that goal is to do this all day everyday. I have the passion, the desire, the want and the imagination.</p>
